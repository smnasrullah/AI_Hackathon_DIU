"""Wave advance: once an open request's current wave has waited a full timeout, the next wave goes.

Safe to run repeatedly and from several workers: the wave number moves with one conditional
UPDATE (status open AND wave_number = N). Only the worker whose UPDATE matched writes the new
recipients and notifies; every other worker matches no row and does nothing. Earlier recipients
stay on the request and are told it is still open. When no wave is left, or nobody is left to
ask, the request is exhausted: expired unfilled, and the distributor and admins are escalated.
