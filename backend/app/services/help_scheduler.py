"""Background loop for the help trigger: one tick every interval (HELP_TRIGGER_INTERVAL_S).

A tick = claim-timeout sweep, wave advance, trigger (help_trigger_run.tick). It runs only
- once bootstrap is ready (before that the tables or the forecast may not exist yet), and in
  DEMO_MODE, after a FRESH bootstrap only (the database was seeded in that run), not before
  HELP_SCHEDULER_DEMO_START_DELAY_S after it became ready (a new demo does not open with a
  burst of requests); a plain restart does not wait again, and
- in the one process holding the leader lock (app/core/leader.py: Postgres advisory lock,
  file lock on SQLite), so several workers or instances never act twice.
Every tick is idempotent anyway (dedupe, compare-and-set moves), as a second line of defence.

The leader writes its status (last_run_at, last_result, next_run_at, last_error) into one
system_meta row, upserted per tick (no admin job row per tick); GET /admin/overview shows it.
Interval 0 turns the loop off. main.py starts it outside tests.
