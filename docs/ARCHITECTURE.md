# Architecture (AgentPulse AI)

Modular monolith: React SPA -> FastAPI `/api/v1` -> PostgreSQL 16. ML artifacts are committed joblib files. LLM provider is optional (`auto` -> replay -> template).
Role codes: **A** agent, **D** distributor, **Ad** admin, **P** public. Scoping: A sees own agent_id only, D sees own agents only, Ad sees all.

| copilot | POST | `/copilot/chat` | Agent Copilot (bn/en): grounded, role-scoped, advisory. Off-topic and injection attempts are refused without an LLM call; every answer is labelled generated_by llm\|replay\|template. | A, D, Ad |

the route's `require_roles` (A, D, Ad; "A, D, Ad" = any signed-in user; P = public). Roles are
checked server-side on every call; scoping (own agent / own agents) is in the services.

### Swap lifecycle (F5)

1. **Proposed**: the nightly precompute's matcher (rules in `app/rules/swap_rules.py` + scipy
   assignment) pairs a donor with surplus and a receiver short of the same float, same
   distributor, within `SWAP_RADIUS_KM`. Status `pending`.
2. **Agents answer** (`POST /swaps/{id}/respond`, accept / decline + note): each side may change
   its answer while the swap is `pending`. Audited (`swap.accept` / `swap.decline`).
3. **Distributor decides** (`POST /swaps/{id}/decision`, approve / reject + required note):
   `approved` or `rejected`, then locked (409 `already_decided`). Approval is refused while an
   agent has declined (409 `swap_declined`). Audited with user id and note; both agents notified.
4. Nothing moves money: an approved swap is a recorded agreement the two agents carry out.

### Help-request lifecycle (liquidity help)

States `open -> claimed -> fulfilled`; `claimed -> open` (helper withdraws, or the claim times
out: reopened); `open -> expired` (deadline passed or every wave failed); `open | claimed ->
cancelled`; `open | expired -> fulfilled` (late confirm by the requester side after a timed-out
claim, within the grace window). All moves are compare-and-set (`app/rules/help_request_rules.py`
TRANSITIONS); anything else is 409.

1. **Created** by the background trigger (forecast: projected balance below the agent's buffer,
   risk red) or, in DEMO_MODE, by the admin's **simulate shortage** (marked simulated). Limits:
   one active request per agent and float, cooldown, rolling daily cap, at most N new per tick;
   in DEMO_MODE at most one automatic request per agent and float per day.
2. **Wave 1**: the requester's distributor plus the best-ranked nearby agents (same distributor,
   within radius, enough surplus, not opted out, fairness rotation); urgent requests ask more.
   Each later wave goes out after `wave_timeout_min` without a claim; after the last wave the
   request expires and the distributor and admins are told.
3. **Claim**: the first helper to accept wins (`/claim`); everyone else is told it is covered.
   The winner may withdraw; an unfinished claim reopens after `claim_timeout_min`.
4. **Confirm**: the requester (or their distributor) confirms the money arrived (`/confirm`, or
   `/confirm-late`), or calls it off (`/cancel`, confirm dialog; distributor only for its own
   agents). Every step is audited and notified; helpers only see a coarse reason category.
5. The scheduler runs this every minute in one leader process (Postgres advisory lock); admins
   see its status, can run one check now, use dry run, and in DEMO_MODE reset the demo state.

## 3. Database tables (PostgreSQL 16)

Money = `NUMERIC(14,2)` BDT. Times = `TIMESTAMPTZ` (Asia/Dhaka on display). Enums as PG enums.

## 5. Fresh-PC bootstrap flow

| # | Step | Where | Action | Success check | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | run.bat / run.sh | host | Check Docker running; copy `.env.example` -> `.env` if missing | `docker info` ok | Print "Start Docker Desktop" and exit |
| 2 | Build + up | compose | `docker compose up --build -d` (db, backend, frontend) | containers created | Show compose logs |
| 3 | DB up | db | Postgres 16 with named volume | healthcheck `pg_isready` | backend waits (`depends_on: service_healthy`) |
| 4 | Migrate | backend entrypoint | `alembic upgrade head` | head revision recorded | Exit non-zero, logs shown |
| 5 | Seed / generate | `bootstrap.py` | If `system_meta.data_version` != code version: generate synthetic data (fixed seed), load agents, hourly, events, weather, demo users, playbook docs | row counts > 0, data_version set | Skipped when already current (idempotent) |
| 6 | Artifacts check | `bootstrap.py` | Verify `ml/artifacts/manifest.json` sha256 + model_version, register in model_runs | all hashes match | Retrain from seed (slow path, logged); fail if still missing |
| 7 | Precompute | `bootstrap.py` | At `SIM_NOW`: forecasts, risk, recommendations, swaps, anomalies, impact | rows for active run | Logged; status shows not ready |
| 8 | LLM mode | backend startup | `LLM_PROVIDER=auto`: key -> live; else replay; miss -> template | `/llm/status` | Always degrades to template, never blocks |
| 9 | Serve | backend + frontend | uvicorn :8000; nginx :8080 proxies `/api` | `GET /api/v1/system/status` -> `ready: true` | run script polls up to 180 s, then prints logs |
| 10 | Ready | host | Open `http://localhost:8080`, print demo logins | browser opens | - |

Reset: `run.bat --reset` -> `docker compose down -v`, then steps 1-10. No internet needed except optional LLM key and optional OSM tiles.
